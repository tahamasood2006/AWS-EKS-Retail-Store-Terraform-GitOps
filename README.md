## Overview

The Retail Store Sample App demonstrates a modern microservices architecture deployed on AWS EKS using GitOps principles. The application consists of multiple services that work together to provide a complete retail store experience:


- **UI Service**: Java-based frontend
- **Catalog Service**: Go-based product catalog API
- **Cart Service**: Java-based shopping cart API
- **Orders Service**: Java-based order management API
- **Checkout Service**: Node.js-based checkout orchestration API


## Application Architecture

The application has been deliberately over-engineered to generate multiple de-coupled components. These components generally have different infrastructure dependencies, and may support multiple "backends" (example: Carts service supports MongoDB or DynamoDB).

| Component                  | Language | Container Image                                                             | Helm Chart                                                                        | Description                             |

## Infrastructure Architecture

The Infrastructure Architecture follows cloud-native best practices:

- **Microservices**: Each component is developed and deployed independently
- **Containerization**: All services run as containers on Kubernetes
- **GitOps**: Infrastructure and application deployment managed through Git
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All AWS resources defined using Terraform
- **CI/CD**: Automated build and deployment pipelines with GitHub Actions

## Quick Start

**Want to deploy immediately?** Follow these steps for a basic deployment:

1. **Install Prerequisites**: AWS CLI, Terraform, kubectl, Docker, Helm
2. **Configure AWS**: `aws configure` with appropriate credentials
3. **Clone Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/LondheShubham153/retail-store-sample-app.git`
4. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Run Terraform in two phases (see [Getting Started](#getting-started))
5. **Access Application**: Get load balancer URL and browse the retail store

**Need advanced GitOps workflow?** See [BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md](./BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md) for automated CI/CD setup.

## Branch Strategy

This repository uses a **dual-branch approach** for different deployment scenarios:

### 🌐 **Public Application (Main Branch)**
- **Purpose**: Simple deployment with public images
- **Images**: Public ECR (stable versions like v1.2.2)
- **Deployment**: Manual control with umbrella chart
- **Updates**: Manual only
- **Best for**: Demos, learning, quick testing, simple deployments

### 🏭 **Production (GitOps Branch)**
- **Purpose**: Full production workflow with CI/CD pipeline
- **Images**: Private ECR (auto-updated with commit hashes)
- **Deployment**: Automated via GitHub Actions
- **Updates**: Automatic on code changes
- **Best for**: Production environments, automated workflows, enterprise deployments
